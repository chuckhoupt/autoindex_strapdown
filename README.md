Background
----------

Since time immemorial, the Apache web server has had the ability to serve up directory
listings (indexes), optionally augmented with text or HTML read-me and/or header files.

GitHub partially emulates Apache's auto-indexes with READMEs, but enhances by adding
Markdown formatting -- the prefect compromise between plain text and HTML.

In a sense, Autoindex-Strapdown is an attempt to backport GitHub's enhanced emulation of
Apache mod_index back to Apache.
